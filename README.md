# Lin's NPC Mod

Copy and paste of the Curseforge description:

This mod adds a _new_ (adult) villager to Stardew Valley named Lin.

Lin stands out from others - He does not participate in the Winter Star, he does not seem to live anywhere, he has no family, he cannot be "romanced", he does not visit the island, he does not ask for items to be delivered to him, and so far, he has horrible textures. (Anybody here a pixel artist?)
